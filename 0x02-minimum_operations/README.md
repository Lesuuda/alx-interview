We'll use the strategy of breaking down the number 
𝑛
n into its prime factors, as each factor will help us determine the number of operations needed to achieve 
𝑛
n "H" characters.

Here’s a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:

Prime Factorization: Break down 
𝑛
n into its prime factors.
Calculate Operations: The total number of operations will be the sum of the prime factors because each prime factor represents a sequence of operations to multiply the current number of "H" characters.
